X Use /newroot rather than /root, less confusing for the casual reader.
* Grub Options:
    rescue=y|n # Loads rescue shell
    quiet=y|n 
    debug=y|n # splits out a little debugging info, possible logs to a file?
    drive[0-9]=UUID|LABEL:key.(gpg|key)|false # specify a key or false for
    paraphrase. #Done
    init=/sbin/init # init initramfs passes off to
    root=/dev/sdaX # root partion (where init lives)
    timeout=30 # seconds to wait for drives to appear
X unset variables we assign in case the main init system does not clear them.
