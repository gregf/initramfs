* $attempts to get passphrase right, 0 to disable.
* Makefile extract and compress for ramdisk file.
* issue or motd file?
* Support for keys inside truecrypt containers
* Support for keys inside StegFS (http://www.mcdonald.org.uk/StegFS/)
* hash of drives to decrypt, example:
    drives = {
        ["drive1"] {device => "/dev/sda2", key=> "foobar.gpg"},
        ["drive2"] {device => "/dev/sdb1", key => "lolcat.gpg"},
        ["drive3"] {device => "/dev/sdc1", key => false },
    }
